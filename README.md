SublimeLinter-contrib-livecodelint
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trevordevore/sublimelinter-contrib-livecodelint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trevordevore/sublimelinter-contrib-livecodelint)

This linter plugin for [SublimeLinter][docs] provides an interface for checking syntax for [LiveCode][livecode-homepage]. It will be used with files that are using the “LiveCode” syntax in Sublime Text.

## Installation
SublimeLinter 3 must be installed in order to use this plugin. If SublimeLinter 3 is not installed, please follow the instructions [here][installation].

### LiveCode Package Installation

You will need to install the [LiveCode Package][livecode-package] before installing the linter.

### LiveCode server executable installation
Before using this plugin, you must ensure that a LiveCode Server executable is installed on your system. To install a version of LiveCode server, do the following:

1. Download the version of `livecode-community-server` from [http://downloads.livecode.com](http://downloads.livecode.com) that you would like to use to check syntax. This plugin has been tested with LiveCode 8.
2. Move the executable to a folder where SublimeLinter will be able to access it. For example, on OS X you might move the `livecode-community-server` file to the `/usr/local/bin` folder.
3. Configure settings as described below in **Settings**.

### Plugin installation
Please use [Package Control][pc] to install the linter plugin. This will ensure that the plugin will be updated when new versions are available. If you want to install from source so you can modify the source code, you probably know what you are doing so we won’t cover that here.

To install via Package Control, do the following:

1. Within Sublime Text, bring up the [Command Palette][cmd] and type `install`. Among the commands you should see `Package Control: Install Package`. If that command is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it. There will be a pause of a few seconds while Package Control fetches the list of available plugins.

2. When the plugin list appears, type `livecodelint`. Among the entries you should see `SublimeLinter-contrib-livecodelint`. If that entry is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it.

### Manual Installation

If you would like to manually install the plugin then place the `SublimeLinter-contrib-livecodelint ` folder in the Sublime Text user package folder. On OS X that folder is `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`.

## Settings
For general information on how SublimeLinter works with settings, please see [Settings][settings]. For information on generic linter settings, please see [Linter Settings][linter-settings].

## LiveCode Script Settings

You can change the default livecodelint behavior in the SublimeLinter User Settings file.

|Setting|Description|
|:------|:----------|
|explicitVariables|Set to "true" to have the linter ensure that variables are declared.|
|executable|The full path to the `livecode-community-server` file on your computer. This is only required if the executable cannot be located in PATH.|

To add these settings use the `Preferences > Package Settings > SublimeLinter > Settings` menu to open the user settings file. Add the following configuration text to the "linters" section:

OS X:

```
"livecodelint": {
    "disable": false,
    "args": [],
    "excludes": [],
    "explicitVariables": "true",
    "executable": "~/livecode-community-server"
}
```

Windows:

```
"livecodelint": {
    "disable": false,
    "args": [],
    "excludes": [],
    "explicitVariables": "true",
    "executable": "C:/livecode-community-server.exe"
}
```

After adding the above settings your user settings will look something like this:

```
{
  "show_panel_on_save": "view",
  "linters": {
    "livecodelint": {
      "disable": false,
      "args": [],
      "excludes": [],
      "explicitVariables": "true",
      "executable": "C:/livecode-community-server.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

## LiveCode Builder Settings

To use the LiveCode Builder linter add a `livecodebuilderlint` entry to the SublimeLinter settings file. There are two properties you need to configure.

|Setting|Description|
|:------|:----------|
|lcCompile|The path to the `lc-compile` executable. This executable is part of the LiveCode installation. The path will look something like this: `/Applications/LiveCode Business 9.0.0.app/Contents/Tools/Toolchain/lc-compile`.|
|modulePaths|The path(s) to any directories containing `lci` files. Each directory is separated by the `;` character. At a minimnum you should include the path to the lci files that ship with LiveCode and lci files that have been installed in your version of the IDE. The path will look something like this: `/Applications/LiveCode Business 9.0.0.app/Contents/Tools/Toolchain/modules/lci;/Users/trevordevore/Dropbox/LiveCode/Extensions/interface`.|

To add these settings use the `Preferences > Package Settings > SublimeLinter > Settings` menu to open the user settings file. Add the following configuration text to the "linters" section:

```
"livecodebuilderlint": {
    "disable": false,
    "args": [],
    "excludes": [],
    "lcCompile": "/Applications/LiveCode Business 9.0.0.app/Contents/Tools/Toolchain/lc-compile",
    "modulePaths": "/Applications/LiveCode Business 9.0.0.app/Contents/Tools/Toolchain/modules/lci;/Users/USERNAME/Dropbox/LiveCode/Extensions/interface"
}
```

## Customizing Settings for a Project

If you need to customize any settings on a per-project basis edit the project settings file and add a SublimeLinter > linters > livecodelint/livecodebuilderlint entry. You will find an example of the syntax below. Note that you must define every search path for `modulePaths`. The value from the main preference file will not be inherited.

```
{
    "folders":
    [
        {
            "path": "."
        }
    ],
    "SublimeLinter":
    {
        "linters":
        {
            "livecodebuilderlint": {
                "modulePaths": ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Notes

The livecodelint.lc file was taken from the [LiveCode language package for Atom][livecode-atom]
